- Write stable and predictable tests that fail only because of changing business logic or layout. No more waits, thread sleep and other flaky staff
- Increase your tests execution speed in general and especially for complex cases like search in big tables, dropdowns with hundreds elements or enter text with thousand lines
- Get detailed logs and good reports of all user actions with no effort
- All UI elements has assertions/matchers that powered by Hamcrest and wait expected condition during timeout
- Easy integration with all modern Automation tools: CI (Jenkins, TC etc.), Logging (Log4j or any other slf4j based logs), Reporting (Allure or Report Portal); Browser/Devices farms (Selenium Grid, Browser Stack, Selenoid etc.), Test Runners (TestNG, JUnit) etc.
